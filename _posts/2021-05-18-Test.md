# Ringdown
As two black holes merge there is a moment right before the final black hole forms where the resultant blob is ___almost___ a black hole, but not quite. 
It's got these extra ripples and spacetime around it is slightly wonky as one would expect, these two highly non linear things just merged. 
The black hole quickly goes through the process of settling down to it's final state, and all the final wonky bits just shoot off to infinity as decaying waves, which we detect with our large detectors.
The part of the waveform that we detect that comes from these decaying waves is called *ringdown*.
$$ S(t) = \sum_{n} A_n e^{i \omega_{n} t} $$
